class Simplifier:
    """
    Expression simplification based on a pre-computed simplification oracle.

    The Simplifier has access to a pre-computed simplification oracle, stores
    inputs, evaluates expressions, determines the equivalence class of
    an expression (based on its input-output behavior) and holds a map
    of equivalence classes that map a list of expressions with the same
    I/O behavior.

    Based on this oracle, the Simplifier walks over an expression 
    represented as an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the root downwards
    and tries to simplify subtrees based on oracle-lookups. 

    The approach is inspired by:
    "QSynth: A Program Synthesis based Approach for Binary Code Deobfuscation" by
    Robin David, Luigi Coniglio and Mariano Ceccato (NDSS, BAR 2020).
    Link: https://archive.bar/pdfs/bar2020-preprint9.pdf

    Similar to QSynth, the Simplifier replaces already simplified subtrees
    in the original expression with placeholder variables to reduce
    the number of variables in too complex expressions. For this, the 
    `_global_variable_prefix` attribute is used.

    The Simplifier applies an SMT-based equivalence check before replacing
    subexpressions for verification. By default, it uses a pre-configured 
    timeout and applies the replacement if the equivalence has been proven 
    or the timeout is triggered. In case a counter-example has been found, 
    the replacement is withdrawn. For higher confidence, the user can limit 
    replacements to successful equivalence checks (ignoring timeouts). 
    For this, the variable `enforce_equivalence` has to be set and, 
    optionally, the `solver_timeout` to be increased.

        oracle (SimplificationOracle): Pre-computed simplification oracle.
        enforce_equivalence (bool): Flag to enforce semantic equivalence checks before replacements.
